## Understanding Your MoodPrint

**MoodPrint** is your unique fingerprint - not who you are, but how you experience and process the world. It's the synthesis of:

- **How you think** - Your cognitive style (patterns, details, stories, feelings)
- **What you've shared** - Your memories, experiences, relationships
- **How to talk to you** - Your preferred communication style
- **How we're doing** - Whether our responses are landing

Think of it like this: two people can have the same problem, but need completely different responses. MoodPrint helps the coach understand what works for YOU.

### Onboarding

When you first use Mood Leaf, you'll answer questions about:
- How you learn best
- How you prefer to communicate
- How you process emotions
- Your social energy

**There are no wrong answers.** This isn't a test - it's discovery.

### What You'll Learn About Yourself

After onboarding, you'll see your MoodPrint - the coach explains you to yourself:

- How your mind naturally processes information
- What helps you understand new ideas
- How emotions work for you
- What communication style fits you

Example MoodPrint reveal:
> "You're a natural systems thinker. You see connections that others miss.
> Emotions come first for you - they're part of how you understand things.
> I'll use metaphors when explaining things, and I'll always validate
> what you're feeling before offering perspective."

### Your MoodPrint Evolves

Your profile isn't fixed. The coach learns:
- What responses work for you
- What doesn't land
- How you're changing over time

You can always tell the coach: "That didn't feel right" and it adapts.

## Tips for Best Experience

### Talking to the Coach

**Do:**
- Be honest about how you're feeling
- Tell it when something doesn't land
- Use it when you need to process, not just when in crisis

**Don't:**
- Expect it to replace therapy
- Depend on it for all emotional support
- Share information you wouldn't tell a trusted friend

### When to Seek Human Help

The coach will encourage you to:
- Talk to friends/family
- See a therapist for persistent struggles
- Call crisis lines if needed

**The coach is a companion, not a replacement for human connection.**
