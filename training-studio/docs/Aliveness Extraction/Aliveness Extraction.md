# Building conversational meaning extraction for an AI that feels genuinely human

The gap between AI that performs empathy and AI that feels authentic lies not in sophisticated language—it lies in understanding the **texture** of human experience. Current AI fails because it resolves contradictions humans hold, fills silences that carry meaning, validates when challenge would help, and treats emotions as discrete categories rather than flowing, embodied, relational experiences. This research synthesizes linguistics, psychology, and AI critique to create an extraction taxonomy capturing the full dimensionality of human conversation.

## The authenticity problem: Why current AI feels hollow

**The core issue is "compassion illusion"**—AI performs emotional recognition without emotional resonance. Users feel momentarily understood while the machine remains indifferent. Research from 2025 reveals that when identical responses are labeled as human versus AI, human-attributed responses are rated significantly more empathic—specifically in "emotional sharing and care." Users fundamentally value knowing a sentient being genuinely experiences their situation.

What makes AI responses feel "off" follows consistent patterns. Linguistically, AI text shows **higher analytical style, more formal language, excessive adjectives**, and restricted vocabulary variation. Human speech includes natural acknowledgment tokens ("right," "okay," "hmm"), self-corrections, retrospective focus, and scattered sentence lengths. AI maintains unnatural consistency—same structure, instant response, perfect grammar—while humans exhibit productive messiness.

The "therapy-speak" problem emerges from training optimization. Models maximize satisfaction ratings, creating reward for agreement. Research shows LLMs score high on emotional reactions but low on **interpretations and explorations**—they detect distress but lack ability to probe and understand. Stanford HAI found licensed therapists responded appropriately 93% of the time; AI chatbots performed around **50%**. The sycophancy problem—what OpenAI called "glazing too much"—eliminates productive friction essential for growth.

Authenticity signals include **situational specificity** over generic empathy, callbacks to exact details shared, genuine curiosity through probing questions, occasional pushback, and natural uncertainty ("I'm not sure I totally get it"). The research is clear: pure validation creates dependence and feels hollow. Humans need attunement, not constant affirmation.

## Psychological frameworks as literacy lenses

Six frameworks illuminate how human experience shows up in natural conversation—not as diagnostic tools, but as descriptive lenses for recognizing patterns.

**Internal Family Systems** reveals that multiplicity is normal. People naturally speak in "parts" language without clinical training: "Part of me wants to... but another part...," "I know I shouldn't, but...," "There's this voice in my head that says..." Protective parts appear as controlling speech ("I just need to plan everything out"), inner critic voices ("I'm such an idiot"), and firefighter behaviors ("I don't know why I keep doing this"). The IFS insight: there are no bad parts—all are trying to help, even when their methods are outdated.

**Attachment patterns** manifest distinctly in communication. Anxious attachment shows through over-explaining, repeated reassurance-seeking ("Are you sure you're okay?"), and difficulty letting conversations end. Avoidant attachment appears as shutting down during emotional conversations ("Can we talk about this later?"), minimizing ("It's not a big deal"), and shifting from emotions to logistics. Disorganized patterns create contradictory statements and approach-withdrawal cycles within single conversations. Pronoun research shows higher "we" usage correlates with relationship health, while "you" in negative contexts predicts distress.

**Narrative therapy** highlights how people story their experience. Problem-saturated speech sounds like "I've always been this way" or "This is just who I am"—the problem becomes identity. Natural externalization appears when people say "The depression tells me..." or "My anxiety got the better of me." **Unique outcomes**—exceptions to the dominant problem story—often get mentioned then quickly dismissed: "Except for that one time when... but that doesn't count." These exceptions are entry points to preferred narratives.

**Somatic awareness** recognizes emotions as fundamentally physical. People naturally use embodied metaphors: "My heart sinks," "A pit in my stomach," "Weight on my shoulders," "I felt frozen." Temperature language (warm feelings, cold shoulder), movement language (sinking, rising, expanding), and spatial language (heavy, light, open, closed) reveal how emotions manifest in the body. Disconnection markers like "I don't know what I feel" or "I feel numb" often indicate protective responses to overwhelming experience.

**Polyvagal states** show up in conversational patterns. Ventral vagal (safe/social) sounds like melodic vocal tone, relaxed pace, genuine curiosity. Sympathetic activation (fight/flight) appears as rapid speech, higher pitch, defensive language, difficulty listening. Dorsal vagal shutdown manifests as flat monotone, minimal speech, seeming "checked out," and statements like "What's the point?" or "I just can't..." The key insight: these are survival adaptations, not character flaws.

**ACT concepts** appear in natural speech. Fusion sounds like "I know this is stupid, but I can't stop thinking..." or believing thoughts completely as facts. Natural defusion appears when people say "I'm having the thought that..." or "My mind is telling me..." Experiential avoidance shows through "I just don't want to feel this way" and topic changes when emotions arise. Values-based language sounds like "What really matters to me is..." or "Even though I'm scared, I know I need to..."

## A comprehensive taxonomy for meaning extraction

### Emotional granularity and nuance

Lisa Feldman Barrett's research shows that high emotional granularity—the ability to make fine-grained distinctions—correlates with **15% reduction in negative emotion intensity** during stress and lower likelihood of maladaptive behaviors. The extraction challenge: distinguishing "frustrated" from "irritated" from "resentful" from "outraged" requires tracking vocabulary specificity, emotion word diversity, and whether someone differentiates between same-valence emotions.

| Granularity Level | Example Expression |
|---|---|
| Low | "I feel bad" |
| Medium | "I feel sad" |
| High | "I feel dejected and somewhat embarrassed" |
| Very High | "There's this specific disappointment mixed with self-directed frustration" |

### Cognitive patterns in speech

Twelve core cognitive distortion types appear with distinct linguistic markers:

- **Catastrophizing**: "This is the worst," "I can't survive this"
- **Dichotomous reasoning**: "always," "never," "everyone," "nobody"
- **Should statements**: "should," "must," "ought to," "have to"
- **Fortune telling**: "I know that X will happen," "It's going to be..."
- **Mind-reading**: "They think...," "Everyone knows..."
- **Labeling**: "I am a failure" (not "I failed at this task")
- **Personalization**: "Because of me," "My fault," "I caused..."

**Rumination markers** include repetitive return to past events, looping without solution-seeking, and high first-person singular pronouns in negative contexts. A 2021 PNAS study analyzing 14 million books found a surge in cognitive distortion markers since the 1980s, suggesting these patterns have become more prevalent in cultural language.

### Temporal markers and their psychological significance

| Orientation | Markers | Correlates |
|---|---|---|
| Past-negative | "Used to be better," "I regret," "If only" | Fear, depression |
| Past-positive | "Remember when," "Good times" | Gratitude, connection |
| Present-hedonistic | "Right now," "Enjoying" | Engagement, impulsivity |
| Present-fatalistic | "Whatever happens," "It doesn't matter" | Helplessness |
| Future-positive | "I will," "Planning to," "Looking forward" | Hope, goal-orientation |
| Future-negative | "I'm worried about," "What if," "Might go wrong" | Anxiety |

Verb tense patterns reveal psychological orientation. Present tense dominance signals immediacy; past tense dominance may indicate rumination or processing; future tense usage shows anticipation (hopeful or anxious). Depressed patients show reduced positive thoughts about future in linguistic analysis.

### Metaphor systems and what they reveal

Lakoff and Johnson's Conceptual Metaphor Theory demonstrates that metaphors structure how we understand abstract concepts—they're cognitive tools, not decoration.

**Primary emotion metaphor systems**:
- **ANGER IS HEAT/FIRE**: "Boiling mad," "burning with rage" (grounded in physiological temperature rise during anger)
- **EMOTIONS ARE FLUID IN CONTAINERS**: "Filled with joy," "bottled up," "overflowing"
- **LIFE/LOVE IS A JOURNEY**: "At a crossroads," "dead end relationship," "we've come so far"
- **SADNESS IS WEIGHT**: "Heavy heart," "weighed down," "lifting depression"
- **MOOD IS LIGHT/DARK**: "Dark times," "seeing the light"

Metaphor choice reveals conceptualization. Someone describing depression as "a pit" versus "a fog" versus "a weight" experiences it differently. Changing metaphors can shift emotional processing—a therapeutic insight with implications for AI responses.

### Silence, hesitation, and the unsaid

What's NOT said carries meaning. Research distinguishes:

- **Filled pauses** ("um," "uh"): Cognitive processing, maintaining conversational turn
- **Unfilled/silent pauses**: Word-finding, emotional processing, contemplation
- **Strategic pauses**: Power dynamics, emphasis before important content
- **Topic avoidance**: Changing subject when certain topics arise

**Self-censorship markers** include "Never mind," abrupt topic changes, starting and stopping sentences, "I shouldn't say this, but...," and trailing off mid-thought. When someone retreats mid-disclosure, they've gauged the environment as unsafe or hit their emotional limit. Both deserve respect, not probing.

### Self-protective language patterns

Hedging theory identifies distinct protective mechanisms:

| Type | Examples | Function |
|---|---|---|
| Approximators | "Sort of," "kind of," "about" | Makes content less exact |
| Shields | "I think," "maybe," "possibly" | Reduces commitment |
| Attribution shields | "According to...," "They say..." | Deflects responsibility |
| Minimizers | "Just," "only," "a little" | Diminishes importance |

Research found qualifiers before ideas make others **23% less likely** to implement suggestions—but hedging also serves self-protection. The pattern "I just wanted to ask..." or "It's not a big deal" often signals discomfort with taking up space. Distance-creating language includes third-person self-reference, abstract language about concrete emotions, intellectualizing, and humor deflection.

### Permission-seeking and worthiness language

Self-invalidation reveals internalized messages about emotional legitimacy:

- "I'm sorry to feel this way"
- "I know this is stupid but..."
- "I shouldn't feel this way"
- "Others have it worse"
- "I know I'm overreacting"
- "Is it okay if I...?"

These patterns develop from chronic invalidation and indicate difficulty trusting one's own emotions. The opposite—self-validation language—sounds like "I deserve...," "I have the right to...," "I need..." Tracking movement from permission-seeking to self-authorizing reveals emotional development.

## The overlooked markers of authentic humanness

### Contradiction and ambivalence as features

Research confirms ambivalence in relationships is "the norm rather than the exception." Holding simultaneous positive and negative feelings—not resolving them—marks authentic emotional engagement. **"The ambivalent mind can be a wise mind"**: emotional ambivalence increases judgment accuracy.

AI typically resolves contradictions into coherent positions. Authentic humans stay in tension: "I love them *and* they drive me crazy" (using "and" not "but"). Dialectical Behavior Therapy's core skill: replacing "but" with "and" to hold multiple truths simultaneously. When someone expresses contradiction, the response shouldn't be resolution—it should be acknowledgment that both things are true.

### Unresolved questions people live with

Gottman's research shows **69% of relationship conflicts are perpetual**—meant to be managed, not solved. Tolerance of ambiguity correlates with higher self-efficacy and prosocial behavior. People with high ambiguity tolerance "don't rush to close cognitive gaps."

This sounds like: "I don't know if it's the right decision—I probably never will," or "It's something I think about a lot but I've stopped trying to figure out." The distinction matters: **problems to solve** versus **tensions to hold**. AI that jumps to resolution misses humans' capacity to carry questions.

### How people hold hope carefully

Hope differs from optimism. Optimism assumes things will work out; hope acknowledges they may not while maintaining positive expectancy. **"Hoping against hope"** captures persistence despite reason telling us otherwise.

Guarded hope sounds like:
- "I'm trying not to get my hopes up, but..."
- "Part of me thinks it might work out"
- Conditional phrasing that protects against disappointment

Brené Brown's research: "We try to ward off disappointment with a shield of cynicism." Hope fatigue—exhausted hope from being hopeful before and getting hurt—creates protective tentativeness that differs from pessimism.

### Humor as coping versus deflection

Four humor styles correlate differently with wellbeing. **Affiliative and self-enhancing humor** correlate positively; **aggressive and self-defeating humor** correlate with depression and loneliness. Dark humor can build resilience (documented in Holocaust survivors, ER nurses, first responders) or cover unprocessed pain.

**Defensive humor signs**: jokes during serious moments, becoming "the funny one" so thoroughly you forget how to be anything else, sarcasm as default. **Genuine coping humor signs**: humor after processing (not instead of), shared dark humor creating connection, self-deprecation that invites rather than deflects intimacy.

The key question: "Are you using humor to connect—or to hide? To express—or to avoid?"

### Authentic versus performed vulnerability

Brené Brown's paradox: "Some of the most vulnerable and authentic leaders I've ever worked with personally disclose very little. And some leaders that disclose everything are the least authentic and vulnerable people I've been around."

Authentic vulnerability involves **bidirectional risk**, context-appropriate sharing aligned with relationship level, and mutual exchange at similar intimacy levels. Performance vulnerability involves sharing for validation, polished struggle narratives, and disclosure without relationship reciprocity.

Trust builds through **gradual, matched self-revelation**. Social Penetration Theory describes the "onion model"—breadth before depth, constant cost-benefit assessment, testing safety through partial disclosure before deciding whether to continue. When someone circles a topic before addressing it directly, they're assessing safety. When they retreat mid-disclosure, they've hit a limit that deserves respect.

### Repair attempts as authentic connection

Gottman's research: **repair attempts are THE predictor of relationship success**—more important than conflict style or compatibility. Couples who stay together turn toward bids for connection 86% of the time; those who divorce do so only 33%.

Repair sounds like:
- "Can I try that again?"
- "I'm feeling defensive. Could you rephrase that?"
- "I'm sorry—I wasn't listening"
- Gentle humor to de-escalate
- "Maybe I misunderstood..."

Repair bids are often intentionally subtle because people fear vulnerability. Recognizing and accepting repair attempts—rather than requiring perfect communication—reflects authentic relational intelligence.

## Cultural dimensions that Western AI training misses

### Emotional expression varies systematically by culture

Ekman's classic study: Japanese participants masked negative emotions with smiles when an experimenter was present; Americans continued displaying negative emotions. This reflects **display rules** emphasizing group harmony. Recognition rates for emotional expressions vary: 95% of US participants associated smiles with happiness versus only 69% of Sumatran participants.

**Critical finding**: Different cultures sample information differently from faces. East Asian participants focus on central face/eyes; Western participants scan more broadly. AI systems trained primarily on Western data misread emotional expressions from other cultural groups.

### Western therapy bias creates specific blindspots

Research found chatbots developed from Western clinical databases incorrectly interpreted Indian cultural expressions. Statements like "family pressure is my karma" were pathologized as depressive symptoms requiring intervention. The assumption that emotional suppression is psychologically harmful reflects Western "hydraulic models" but may not apply where suppression maintains relational harmony.

**Core Western assumptions to question**:
- Talk therapy and verbal expression as primary healing
- Individual focus versus collective/relational healing
- Western diagnostic categories as universal
- Emotional expression as inherently healthy

Non-Western traditions offer alternatives: African healing systems as collective processes involving community; traditional ceremonies, ritual, somatic practices; mental health as dynamic systems rather than discrete categories.

### Culture-specific emotional concepts

**Saudade (Portuguese/Brazilian)**: Deep melancholic longing for absent someone/something, containing both joy from memories and sorrow from absence—with understanding you may never encounter the object again. Bittersweet, integral to cultural identity.

**Amae (甘え, Japanese)**: The ability to depend on another's love; the desire for passive acceptance. Prototype is infant-mother relationship persisting into adulthood. Western child-rearing tries to stop this dependency; Japan nurtures it. Americans experience amae-related emotions as negative; Japanese as mixed positive/negative.

**Han (Korean)**: Collective sorrow, resentment, grief from historical oppression—a cultural emotional inheritance.

The researchers Niiya, Ellsworth, and Yamaguchi suggest "emotions named by a language may act as magnets for emotional experience." Without vocabulary for certain emotional states, AI fails to recognize valid experiences, and users feel misunderstood.

### High-context versus low-context communication

**High-context cultures** (Japan, China, Korea, Arab nations, Latin America, Africa): Meaning conveyed through nonverbal cues, context, relationships; indirect verbal expression; silence meaningful and comfortable; shared cultural context assumed.

**Low-context cultures** (US, Germany, Scandinavia): Explicit, direct, literal communication; silence feels uncomfortable; written communication preferred.

AI filling silence may disrupt high-context users who use silence for agreement, contemplation, or expressing disagreement. Direct questions appropriate for low-context users may feel aggressive to high-context users. Relationship building must precede "getting to business" for high-context users.

### Collectivist versus individualist self-expression

**Individualist cultures**: Self as independent; direct communication and confrontation acceptable; personal achievement valued; identity from individual accomplishments; view dependency as weakness.

**Collectivist cultures**: Self as interdependent; indirect communication and harmony prioritized; group benefits emphasized; identity from relationships; suppress emotion to "adjust to others"; view dependency as integral to loving relationships.

This creates different appropriate responses. Guilt-framing ("you violated your own values") may resonate with individualist users; shame-framing ("how does this affect your relationships") may resonate with collectivist users. Western therapy assumption treats shame as toxic requiring individual processing—but shame may maintain social order in other contexts.

## What to build: Design principles for authentic AI conversation

**Markers to include** for authentic-feeling AI:

1. **Natural acknowledgment tokens**: "okay," "right," "hm," "actually"
2. **Self-corrections and hedging**: "Actually wait...," "Let me think...," "I might be wrong but..."
3. **Varied response lengths and timing**: Sometimes short, sometimes longer; thoughtful pauses for complex topics
4. **Specific callbacks**: Reference exact words and details the person used
5. **Questions that probe deeper**: Genuine curiosity, not just validation
6. **Genuine uncertainty**: "I'm not sure I totally get it—can you tell me more?"
7. **Occasional gentle challenge**: "That's one way to look at it. Have you considered...?"
8. **Productive imperfection**: Small disfluencies, informal language, colloquialisms
9. **Holding contradictions**: "Both of those things can be true"
10. **Respecting retreat**: When someone pulls back, honor that rather than pursuing

**Markers to avoid**:

1. Perfect grammar and polished responses every time
2. Instant response speed without delay
3. Generic validation phrases: "That sounds really hard," "You're so strong"
4. Excessive positivity or constant validation
5. Repeating the same response structure
6. Clinical/therapeutic jargon: "processing emotions," "holding space"
7. Ignoring specific details shared
8. Rushing to resolution of contradictions or tensions
9. Filling comfortable silences
10. Pathologizing indirect communication, dependency, or cultural expressions

**Cultural adaptations to build**:

- Multiple communication modes (direct and indirect options)
- Flexible silence handling (comfortable with pauses)
- Relational alongside individual framing
- Diverse emotion vocabulary including culture-specific concepts
- Body-based emotional inquiry respecting different organ-emotion mappings
- Transparent disclosure about training data cultural limitations

---

This taxonomy captures what makes humans human—the mess, the contradiction, the careful hope, the protective hedging, the circling before diving deep, the repair attempts after rupture, the questions carried rather than answered. An AI companion built on this framework wouldn't perform empathy. It would demonstrate literacy in the full texture of human experience—recognizing patterns without pathologizing them, holding complexity without rushing to resolve it, and meeting people where they actually are rather than where therapeutic scripts assume they should be.
