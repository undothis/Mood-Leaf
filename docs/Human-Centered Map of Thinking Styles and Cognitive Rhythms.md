1. PURPOSE OF THIS FRAMEWORK

This document defines a non-hierarchical, non-diagnostic framework for understanding how different people think, learn, relate, and cycle through states of clarity and difficulty.

Its goals are to:
    •    Replace “smart vs not smart” with how minds operate
    •    Normalize cognitive differences that school and testing often miss
    •    Help an AI coach adapt how it listens, responds, and teaches
    •    Give users language to understand themselves without being boxed in

This is not a personality test.
This is a map of cognitive motion.

2. CORE PRINCIPLE

There is no single “normal” way to think.

People differ along multiple axes:
    •    How insight arrives
    •    How information is processed
    •    How meaning is constructed
    •    How energy fluctuates
    •    How relationships are navigated in conversation

Most people are a blend, with one or two dominant modes.

3. PRIMARY THINKING / COGNITIVE MODES

Below are major thinking styles. None are better than others. Each excels in different environments and fails in others.

⸻

A. Procedural–Sequential Thinker

“Show me the steps.”
    •    Thinks linearly and incrementally
    •    Comfortable with rules, instructions, formulas
    •    Learns best through repetition and structure
    •    Often performs well in traditional education

Struggles with:
    •    Ambiguity
    •    Open-ended problems
    •    Vague or metaphorical explanations

Needs from a coach:
    •    Clear steps
    •    Predictable structure
    •    Concrete instructions

⸻

B. Analytical–Symbolic Thinker

“Let me analyze the variables.”
    •    Thinks in abstractions and symbols
    •    Enjoys logic, definitions, precision
    •    Often good at math, coding, formal reasoning

Struggles with:
    •    Emotional ambiguity
    •    Ill-defined problems
    •    Subjective or narrative framing

Needs from a coach:
    •    Clear reasoning chains
    •    Definitions
    •    Logical clarity

⸻

C. Conceptual Systems Intuitor

“I see how this all fits together.”
    •    Thinks in wholes, patterns, and relationships
    •    Internally simulates systems
    •    Often invents frameworks independently
    •    Understands meaning before mechanics

Struggles with:
    •    Timed tests
    •    Rote learning
    •    Explaining step-by-step

Needs from a coach:
    •    Big-picture framing
    •    Metaphors
    •    Permission to explore before formalizing

⸻

D. Narrative–Meaning Thinker

“What’s the story here?”
    •    Understands life through narrative and identity
    •    Strong emotional memory
    •    Insight comes through storytelling and reflection

Struggles with:
    •    Dry abstraction
    •    Decontextualized facts
    •    Emotionless instruction

Needs from a coach:
    •    Story-based prompts
    •    Emotional mirroring
    •    Identity-aware language

⸻

E. Embodied / Somatic Thinker

“I know it in my body.”
    •    Processes through sensation, movement, and action
    •    Learns by doing rather than explaining
    •    Often struggles to verbalize insight

Struggles with:
    •    Purely verbal or abstract explanations
    •    Sitting still for long reflection

Needs from a coach:
    •    Grounded, sensory language
    •    Body-based prompts
    •    Practical experimentation

⸻

F. Associative / Divergent Thinker

“Everything connects to everything.”
    •    Rapid idea generation
    •    Nonlinear, associative thinking
    •    Creative, inventive, exploratory

Struggles with:
    •    Focus
    •    Completion
    •    Linear planning

Needs from a coach:
    •    Gentle containment
    •    Idea clustering
    •    Permission to wander, then return

⸻

G. Emotional–Relational Thinker

“How does this affect people?”
    •    Highly attuned to others’ emotions
    •    Reads tone, subtext, and relational dynamics
    •    Often underestimates own intelligence

Struggles with:
    •    Impersonal systems
    •    Harsh feedback
    •    Pure logic without context

Needs from a coach:
    •    Emotional attunement
    •    Relational validation
    •    Gentle guidance

⸻

H. Visual–Spatial Thinker

“I see it.”
    •    Thinks in images, shapes, spatial models
    •    Strong at design, architecture, systems
    •    Often poor with verbal or symbolic tests

Struggles with:
    •    Dense text
    •    Verbal-only explanations

Needs from a coach:
    •    Visual metaphors
    •    Spatial framing
    •    Chunked information

⸻

I. Temporal / Foresight Thinker

“Where does this lead?”
    •    Thinks in timelines and long arcs
    •    Anticipates consequences and futures
    •    Often feels anxious due to over-anticipation

Struggles with:
    •    Present-moment focus
    •    Slow-moving environments

Needs from a coach:
    •    Future-oriented reflection
    •    Scenario exploration
    •    Grounding in the present

⸻

J. Integrative / Meta Thinker

“How do these thinking styles interact?”
    •    Thinks about thinking
    •    Comfortable with paradox
    •    Holds multiple perspectives simultaneously

Struggles with:
    •    Simplistic answers
    •    Being forced into one identity

Needs from a coach:
    •    Meta-reflection
    •    Philosophical framing
    •    Permission not to resolve everything

⸻

4. COGNITIVE RHYTHMS (VERY IMPORTANT)

Beyond style, people differ in rhythm.

A. Steady-State Minds
    •    Fairly consistent clarity and energy
    •    Linear productivity
    •    Rare extreme highs or lows

B. Cyclical / Wave-Based Minds
    •    Periods of high synthesis and insight
    •    Followed by low-energy, low-clarity phases
    •    Insight feels sudden; depletion feels existential

Key truth:
Low phases are not failure — they are integration and recovery.

This framework must normalize cycles, not pathologize them.

⸻

5. WHY TESTS & SCHOOL MISS MANY MINDS

Traditional education and IQ testing favor:
    •    Speed
    •    Symbol manipulation
    •    Working memory
    •    Procedural reasoning

They do not measure:
    •    Systems intuition
    •    Conceptual synthesis
    •    Narrative intelligence
    •    Emotional intelligence
    •    Long-term foresight

This creates false narratives of “low intelligence” in people whose intelligence is nonlinear or contextual.

⸻

6. IMPLICATIONS FOR AN AI COACH

An effective AI coach must:
    •    Adapt how it speaks, not just what it says
    •    Match structure to the user’s thinking style
    •    Adjust pacing, tone, and framing
    •    Recognize cognitive cycles
    •    Avoid forcing a “default” mode

Mismatch creates resistance.
Alignment creates trust.

⸻

7. HOW THIS FRAMEWORK SHOULD BE USED
    •    As onboarding self-discovery, not testing
    •    As coach configuration, not labels
    •    As evolving understanding, not static identity
    •    As permission, not definition

Users must be able to say:

“This fit then, but I’ve changed.”

⸻

8. FINAL PRINCIPLE

Intelligence is not a number.
It is a motion.

This framework exists to help people:
    •    Understand how their mind moves
    •    Stop fighting their natural rhythm
    •    Be met where they are
